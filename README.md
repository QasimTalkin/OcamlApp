# OcamlApp Notes. 

• Garbage collection for automatic memory management, now a feature of almost every modern, high-level language.

• First-class functions that can be passed around like ordinary values, as seen in Java‐ Script, Common Lisp, and C#.

• Static type-checking to increase performance and reduce the number of runtime errors, as found in Java and C#.

• Parametric polymorphism, which enables the construction of abstractions that work across different data types, similar to generics in Java and C# and templates in C++.

• Good support for immutable programming, i.e., programming without making de‐ structive updates to data structures. This is present in traditional functional languages like Scheme, and is also found in distributed, big-data frameworks like Hadoop.

• Automatic type inference to avoid having to laboriously define the type of every single variable in a program and instead have them inferred based on how a value is used. Available in a limited form in C# with implicitly typed local variables, and in C++11 with its auto keyword.

• Algebraic data types and pattern matching to define and manipulate complex data structures. Available in Scala and F#.
